Final Report

This document describes how the complete graphs for all zoom levels
was constructed and how well our algorithms did.

Step 1: OSM Import
==================

This step imports the railway graph from the osm data:

    java -jar osm_railway_graph_import.jar germany.osm 127.0.0.1 27017

Step 2: Our Algorithms
======================

This is the step were our project kicks in. It works on the railway
graph and produces a generalized railway graph for each zoom level.

The main entry point for producing generalized railway graphs is
`al_filter`:

  .. program-output:: al_filter --help

The zoom levels indicate what collection will be produced. For example,
running `al_filter 14` will produce the collection `railway_graph_14`.

In the following sections, the images on the left-hand side represent
the Frankfurt Main Station and the image on the right-hand side represent
Germany.

Zoom level 30
-------------

This is no zoom level that is used by google maps. Instead, this
is our general cleaning step that does the following:

- Remove nodes that have no neighbors

- Remove duplicates (nodes with the same `loc` attribute)

- Recalculate all distances (great-circle distance)

This step is executed by running::

    al_filter 30

.. all images were produced using
   al_visualize_rg -s doc/img/step-x.png -t "Zoom Level x" \
                   --dpi 75 -c railway_graph_x

The following table illustrates the application of our algorithms
and the result thereof.
