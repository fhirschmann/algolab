Algorithm Lab documentation
===========================

During the algorithm lab project, we developed a framework for cleaning,
combining, segmenting and simplifying cartographic data, with an emphasis
on train tracks. Below you'll find several algorithms for each of the
mentioned sections as well as documentation on how to set up our project.
