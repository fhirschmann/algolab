Discarded Approaches
====================

Filtering of railway graph nodes based on valuation
---------------------------------------------------

We planned to value railway graph nodes and omit nodes which did not exceed a
threshold appropriate for a given zoomlevel.

We did not pursued this approach as it was difficult to find suitable metrics to
value the nodes. This was easy for certain classes of nodes, e.g. nodes with a
nearby station or endpoints, but for most nodes we could not find a method to
valuate them.
